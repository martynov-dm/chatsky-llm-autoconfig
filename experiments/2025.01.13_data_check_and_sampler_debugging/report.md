# Debugging dialogue sampler

## Issues and goals

I believe current dialogue sampler can malfunction on a more complex graphs. We will check this.
Also here I will score the data we already have.

## Hypothesises and steps

Using our old metrics.

## Results

Fixed some data formatting issues, final data is in `data.json` file.

Metric results:

- are_triplets_valid: 1.0
- is_theme_valid: 0.7
- all_utterances_present: 0.8

## Future plans

All things to be considered by future researchers, plans on next experiments and so on
